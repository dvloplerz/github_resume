For now, I'm only implemented main components of this app. (server side)
I'm planning for a front-end development. (maybe Next.js for web-ui, and #ratatui(https://ratatui.rs/) for a CLI client. ) 
At this time this app can only use with cURL, POSTMAN and cannot store a task list. (because this app not implemented a database yet!)
# WIP~!!!
